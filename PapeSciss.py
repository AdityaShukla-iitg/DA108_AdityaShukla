# Subject: Rock-Paper-Scissors Game
# This game demonstrates the use of:
# 1. Lists: To store possible choices for the user and computer.
# 2. Dictionaries: For mapping the winning conditions.
# 3. Random Module: To randomly assign a choice to the computer.
# 4. Input Validation: Ensures the user enters valid choices.
# 5. Control Structures:
#    - Nested `if` statements (used previously, now refactored). Line number 31-50
#    - `elif` for decision-making. Line number 61-88
#    - Dictionary-based win logic (current implementation).Line number 97-101
